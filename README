This is a simple YUI3 module dependency graph visualizer. It uses the
GPL-ed TouchGraph (TGLinkBrowser java applet) for visualization.

Usage:

* Place this repository folder into your yui3/build folder
* Make the folder accessible using your browser through http:// URL
* Navigate your browser to that URL
* Wait for a while
* Enjoy the dependency graph

This is just a toy project to get a glimps on the module dependencies.

Enjoy!
