This is a simple YUI3 module dependency graph visualizer. It uses the
GPL-ed TouchGraph (TGLinkBrowser java applet) for visualization.

What does it do and how:
========================

* It goes and scans the filesystem for javascript files (files.php)
* Runs Rhino JS engine with just enough fake browser objects and
  YUI.add() to catch all the YUI3 module registrations (modwiz.js)
* Using the module metadata it generates a TouchGraph TGLinkBrowser
  XML file representing modules /graph nodes/ and their dependency 
  /edges/ (modwiz.php)
* It renders the modules graph in a browser using a java apple
  (index.hml, TGLinkBrowser.jar...)

Usage:
======

* Place this repository folder into your yui3/build folder
* It is by default configured to scan for *-debug.js files (check
  files.php to adjust)
* Make modwiz folder accessible using your browser through http:// URL
* Navigate your browser to that URL
* Wait for a while
* Enjoy the dependency graph


All in all this is just a toy project to get a glimps on the module
dependencies.
